# Python-Malware-Analysis-Tools

This repository contains Python scripts and tools for analyzing malware and performing various analysis tasks on binary files. The scripts utilize popular libraries like pefile for parsing PE files, hashlib for calculating file hashes, and OTXv2 for retrieving threat intelligence data from AlienVault OTX.

Features
Hexadecimal Editor: View the hexadecimal representation of a binary file.
File Hashes: Calculate MD5, SHA-256, and SHA-1 hashes of the file.
Import Analysis: Analyze imported DLLs and their functions in PE files.
AlienVault OTX Integration: Retrieve threat intelligence data using MD5 hash from AlienVault OTX.
String Extraction: Extract printable strings from the binary file.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pefile: Install using pip install pefile
OTXv2: Install using pip install OTXv2
Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/PythonMalwareAnalysis.git
Replace OTX_API_KEY with your valid AlienVault OTX API key in the Python scripts.
Run the Python scripts using python script_name.py and provide the path to the binary file you want to analyze.
